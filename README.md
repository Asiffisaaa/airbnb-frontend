This is the frontend for my Airbnb Clone project, built in React with Vite. It includes both the user-facing Airbnb pages and the admin dashboard, which is located inside src/pages/admin. To run the project, install dependencies with npm install and start the development server with npm run dev. The app usually runs at http://localhost:5173. The user interface includes the Home Page, Location Page, and Listing Details Page, while the admin dashboard includes login, create listing, edit listing, and dashboard views. All pages communicate with the backend API at http://localhost:5000 using Axios, and admin features require the stored JWT token. The project follows the structure and requirements specified in the Airbnb Capstone brief and rubric.
